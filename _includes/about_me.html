          I have over 12 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
          at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient with many
          programming environment, my expertise is in Java programming.

          In my current company I work as a team leader in a couple of defense based projecs.
          My main responsibility is to design the infrastructure of the systems and direct the team
          members for optimal output. I'm a coder and I love programing.
          Therefore I'm also writing code to solve everyday issues with the teams members.
          <!--
          To be honest I do not like mundane tasks (such as reporting etc.) and trying to automate that kind of tasks is one of my passions.
          tasks programming is the number one 
          I love building things, solving problems.
          While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
          I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
          I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
          team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
          architecture and project management.
