          I have over 12 years of experience as a software engineer and have worked at small startups and large organizations. While I'm proficient with many programming environments, my expertise is in Java programming.

          In my current company, I work as a team leader in a couple of defense-based projects. My main responsibility is to design the infrastructure of the systems and direct the team members for optimal output. I'm a coder and I love programming. Therefore I'm also writing code to solve everyday issues with the team members.
